# Case Study: TheLook eCommerce Optimization Analysis

## Background

You are provided with datasets from TheLook, an eCommerce platform selling clothing. The
dataset encompasses various facets of the business including distribution centers, web events,
inventory, order items, orders, products, and user data. You can find the [data](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/bigquery-public-data/thelook-ecommerce) here using
Google’s bigquery-public-data project. Access it by signing in with a Google/Gmail account.

## Objective

Your task is not only to analyze the data but also to provide actionable business insights that
could guide TheLook's strategy to operate more optimally and enhance the overall customer
experience. Please prepare a response to each question below and be ready to discuss both
your answer and your thought process for each. The tools you use to perform the analysis and
present your results are up to you, but expect that the audience for your presentation will ask
you to walk through any queries, code, or formulas behind your numbers.

## Question 1: Product Porfolio

Assess the profitability of each product category. Are there significant differences between
them? If so, what might TheLook consider changing about its product mix to increase margins
overall?

## Question 2: Website Traffice

Using the `events` table, analyze the performance of TheLook’s website. Determine if there are
particular segments of traffic that overperform or underperform in terms of conversion (define
“conversion” in this context as the percentage of sessions that lead to a purchase). What
recommendations would you make to management to improve this KPI?

## Question 3: Returned Orders

The management team at TheLook has become concerned about the rate at which customers
are returning items they’ve purchased. Find out whether there is a primary driver or set of
drivers for returns and offer recommendations for how to address them.

## Things to Keep in Mind

We are more interested in the process you follow, and what type of considerations and tradeoffs
you would consider when you come to your conclusions and recommendations. Structure your
ideas so you can succinctly convey key points, enable quick decision making and influence
others and seek buy-in.
